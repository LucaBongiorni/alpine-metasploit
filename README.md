# alpine-metasploit
alpine-metasploit

This Docker image allow to run the latest metasploit on Alpine Linux.
This image can work with or without database support, but having a DB is highly reccomended.

alpine-metasploit works out-of-the-box with official Postgresql docker image:

docker run -d --name=postgres postgres"

Enjoy.
